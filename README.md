  I'm an avid programming puzzle-seeker, on a real note; I'm a High School student & teacher's aid for CTE Game Design in my Junior year (11th Grade) with a Certificate of Completion in CTE Web Design/Development (June 2020) & a partial completion in CTE Game Design/Development (June 2019). My personal life is compiled of work, family and school with a mix of hobbies such as playing computer games and dedicating my free time to private, public or community project creation and development.

I've been apart of or have led a good amount of projects; one of my recent projects was a website and newsletter system that was created by me for my High School's Key Club Charter. I'm typically available for freelancing most of the time; if it is a non-profit & for good cause, I'm glad to volunteer my experience into any development it would need.

Here's a life story: I've been on the computer since 2007 (approx. 3 years old) and I gained knowledge about how computers work and throughout my time in elementary and middle school, I would impress my teachers, parents & friends after showing them something they didn't know about on the computer, I was then further led into development after my 6th science teacher which who was also a robotics elective teacher using LEGO's STEM noticed that I had been playing around with Chrome's "DevTools" (specifically the Inspect Element window) and Scratch; he would then persuade my parents into putting me into said robotics class, which had me interested at the time, and the rest is history. I can now say without a doubt that computer programming & development is a passion to me and has been an important part of my life ever since I started learning HTML and JavaScript in the 7th grade.
